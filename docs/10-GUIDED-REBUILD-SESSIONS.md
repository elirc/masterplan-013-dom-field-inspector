# Rebuild DOM Field Inspector through small verified slices

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

This is a hypothetical reconstruction exercise using the existing reference as a comparison point. Work on a practice branch or a separate scratch copy. Do not erase the working reference. Your goal is to recover the important decisions from requirements, not reproduce every character or configuration file from memory.

## Session zero: write a contract you can challenge

Submission prevents navigation and validates a trimmed name and a simple email shape. Blank names and malformed addresses receive field-specific errors and focus moves to the first invalid field. Valid input remains in its control. Correcting and resubmitting clears old errors. Nothing is sent; email deliverability and complete address-standard validation are outside this exercise.

Your target skill is dom events and validation boundaries. Write three examples before implementation: one ordinary success, one boundary distinction and one recovery or repeat sequence. Reuse the fixed reference fixtures only after making a prediction. If your new example is outside the documented scope, decide whether to reject it or explicitly expand the contract; do not let an incidental implementation choice decide silently.

Write a short non-goal list tied to this exercise. Non-goals keep an assistant from adding a database, a UI framework or a broad refactor before you understand the central rule. For static layout work, a meaningful non-goal may be scripting interactions that native HTML already handles. For stateful work, it may be remote persistence or a global state container.

## Slice 1: Name the boundaries

**Reference context:** Start from the two labeled inputs in public/index.html. Notice novalidate: the workshop owns its submit feedback instead of competing with the browser's built-in error bubble. The email input still communicates its purpose. The instructional regex recognizes a simple shape; do not describe that as proof an address exists.

### Your implementation route

1. Inspect `public/core.js` and the related adapter `public/app.js`. Write which responsibility belongs to each for this slice. A path is a place to inspect, not automatic permission to edit every file.
2. State the example independently: **Name contains only spaces; email is valid → Name error, focus on name, email remains untouched**. Explain which requirement supplies the expected answer.
3. Build the smallest version that can express the example. Start with explicit data and direct control flow. Introduce a helper only when you can name its input, output and reason to change.
4. Observe the result through the real boundary: a command, a browser control, or a layout condition. A function returning the right value does not prove a button passes it the right input.
5. Add a neighboring example that would fail if you special-cased the first one. Review your diff before comparing with the reference.

### Pause at the first uncertainty

Write the smallest question you cannot answer. It might concern ownership, a comparison operator, the effect of deleting a property, or when a callback actually runs. Include the exact expression and an example. Ask a mentor for one clue, then return to the source; avoid requesting a complete replacement implementation.

### Inspect an alternative

Choose one plausible different design for this slice. Describe the extra state, dependency or maintenance rule it introduces. If it satisfies the same contract, it is not automatically wrong. Compare the cost of making the next small change. If it violates the contract, provide the smallest concrete example that demonstrates that violation.

### Capture a reviewable stopping point

Record your actual check: npm test, plus the relevant real interaction or CLI observation. State what it established and what remains untested. Use a commit message about the resulting behavior rather than a list of file names. If the slice does not work yet, keep the uncertainty visible in the journal instead of writing a success narrative.

**Left for you:** the code, fixture values beyond the supplied example, exact naming and the acceptance evidence. The reference is available for comparison after an attempt; it is not evidence that your branch has passed.

## Slice 2: Keep the core pure

**Reference context:** Trace values and errors through validateFields. trim creates normalized strings, while the original object stays unchanged. Empty-after-trim is the meaningful name boundary. A test containing a regular nonempty name cannot distinguish a correct validator from one that accepts spaces as a name.

### Your implementation route

1. Inspect `public/core.js` and the related adapter `public/app.js`. Write which responsibility belongs to each for this slice. A path is a place to inspect, not automatic permission to edit every file.
2. State the example independently: **Correct the name and resubmit → Ready to review; no stale name error**. Explain which requirement supplies the expected answer.
3. Build the smallest version that can express the example. Start with explicit data and direct control flow. Introduce a helper only when you can name its input, output and reason to change.

## Slice 3: Render errors accessibly

**Reference context:** Follow each error key into the matching paragraph and aria-invalid attribute. aria-describedby connects the field with its explanation. Focus is an effect performed after the result is known; it does not belong inside the pure validator. Verify focus with the keyboard as well as reading a red message.

1. Inspect `public/core.js` and the related adapter `public/app.js`. Write which responsibility belongs to each for this slice. A path is a place to inspect, not automatic permission to edit every file.

## Slice 4: Exercise recovery

**Reference context:** Submit a blank name with a valid email, correct only the name and submit again. Then change a successful email into an invalid value. The old success sentence should disappear while editing. These sequences test state transitions, which isolated valid and invalid screenshots would miss.

## Reconstruct the whole path without the guide

Submit → preventDefault → read two strings from controls → validateFields returns normalized values and an error map → app writes each error and aria-invalid → focus first failing field or display review text.

Close this page and redraw that route from memory using your own labels. Open the code only to resolve a specific uncertainty. Then trace a different valid input and one boundary. If your picture requires a hidden value that you cannot locate in the source, investigate it; diagrams can invent state just as easily as prose can.

## Compare your implementation fairly

First compare behavior and evidence. Only then compare style and abstractions. A shorter implementation may be harder for you to explain; a longer implementation may duplicate a rule that later drifts. State the concrete tradeoff. Do not treat matching the reference line for line as the only successful outcome.

## Finish with a teach-back

Explain why `validateFields` is enough for its present responsibility, which work remains in `public/app.js`, and which future requirement would justify changing that boundary. Answer the original transfer question: Which values come from the DOM and which values have already been validated? Keep the answer short enough that another junior can challenge it with an example.
