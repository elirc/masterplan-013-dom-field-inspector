# M013: deeper debugging casebook

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

The incidents below are hypothetical teaching scenarios based on realistic mistakes in this codebase. They are not claims that the shipped reference is broken. Reproduce a proposed defect only on a disposable practice branch. Keep an observed failure separate from a likely explanation; the point of an experiment is to make those two agree or disagree.

## Incident 1: The page reloads before errors can be read

**Fictional report:** A learner says, “The page reloads before errors can be read.” They supply no diagnosis. Your job is to reduce the report to a reproducible difference from the contract.

**Candidate defect for the lab:** Remove preventDefault from the submit handler in a scratch branch.

**Starting experiment:** Submit and compare the URL and field contents.

### Triage before touching the code

Record the exact input or content, the action, the expected result and the actual result. Check whether you are running the file or branch you think you are running. A browser may be showing an older served directory; a terminal may be in a different repository. Confirm the environment using ordinary read-only inspection before changing a product rule.

The relevant promise is: Submission prevents navigation and validates a trimmed name and a simple email shape. Blank names and malformed addresses receive field-specific errors and focus moves to the first invalid field. Valid input remains in its control. Correcting and resubmitting clears old errors. Nothing is sent; email deliverability and complete address-standard validation are outside this exercise. Extract only the sentence this incident violates. Do not rewrite the whole contract to fit an accidental result. If the reported behavior is outside scope, document that first; an unsupported case is not automatically a regression.

### Keep two hypotheses alive

Hypothesis A: the owning rule near `validateFields` is wrong. Hypothesis B: the rule is correct but `public/app.js` supplies or presents the wrong value or state. Name the observation each hypothesis predicts.

Use the smallest controlled experiment that makes the predictions differ. Reading more files is not always a better experiment. A single exact boundary value, a changed call order or a computed style can be more decisive than a large random fixture. Record the outcome before making the repair.

### Locate the causal boundary

public/app.js: the submit event owns navigation prevention.

Explain why this location can produce the symptom. A line near the visible error is not necessarily the cause; the wrong value may have been produced earlier. Conversely, a plausible architectural theory is weak if the actual event handler never reaches the suspected function. Follow one trace end to end rather than searching for a fashionable anti-pattern.

### Repair narrowly and look for neighboring damage

Make the smallest coherent repair that restores the contract. Rerun the discriminating example, then one ordinary neighboring case and one recovery or repeat sequence. If the repair only special-cases the chosen fixture, propose a second input that exposes that weakness. A regression should preserve the reason for the fix, not merely the exact spelling of one fixture.

### Write a short incident note

Use these fields: symptom; violated promise; competing hypotheses; experiment; actual observation; owning rule; repair; regression; remaining uncertainty. Avoid claiming the hypothetical incident happened in the original build history. The supplied narrative is a practice route; your own note should describe only the experiment you actually performed.

**After a break:** explain “The page reloads before errors can be read” again without opening the location hint. If you can recall only the file name, repeat the input-to-output trace. The useful memory is the causal relationship, not where a previous assistant told you to click.

## Incident 2: Spaces pass as a name

**Fictional report:** A learner says, “Spaces pass as a name.” They supply no diagnosis. Your job is to reduce the report to a reproducible difference from the contract.

**Candidate defect for the lab:** Validate the raw string length before trimming.

**Starting experiment:** Submit three spaces with a valid email.

### Triage before touching the code

A browser may be showing an older served directory; a terminal may be in a different repository. Confirm the environment using ordinary read-only inspection before changing a product rule.

### Locate the causal boundary

public/core.js: normalize before checking the name rule.

Explain why this location can produce the symptom. A line near the visible error is not necessarily the cause; the wrong value may have been produced earlier. Conversely, a plausible architectural theory is weak if the actual event handler never reaches the suspected function. Follow one trace end to end rather than searching for a fashionable anti-pattern.

## Incident 3: A corrected field still sounds invalid

**Fictional report:** A learner says, “A corrected field still sounds invalid.” They supply no diagnosis. Your job is to reduce the report to a reproducible difference from the contract.

**Candidate defect for the lab:** Forget to clear aria-invalid or its old message.

**Starting experiment:** Fail name, then correct and resubmit; inspect text and attributes.

### Triage before touching the code

Record the exact input or content, the action, the expected result and the actual result. Check whether you are running the file or branch you think you are running. A browser may be showing an older served directory; a terminal may be in a different repository. Confirm the environment using ordinary read-only inspection before changing a product rule.

### Locate the causal boundary

public/app.js: feedback must be rebuilt for both fields every submit.

Explain why this location can produce the symptom. A line near the visible error is not necessarily the cause; the wrong value may have been produced earlier. Conversely, a plausible architectural theory is weak if the actual event handler never reaches the suspected function. Follow one trace end to end rather than searching for a fashionable anti-pattern.

## When a proposed repair fails

Stop adding edits. Compare the new symptom with the old one and inspect the diff. Decide whether the experiment rejected your hypothesis or whether the repair failed to change the intended boundary. Revert only your own experimental change if needed, preserve other work, and try the next discriminating input.
